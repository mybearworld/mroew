Install Gleam and Git if you haven&#39;t already.\n2. Create a Gleam project:\n   ```sh\n   gleam new my-scratch-project\n   ```\n3. Delete the `.github` and `test` folders.\n4. Add Mröw as a submodule:\n   ```sh\n   git submodule add https://github.com/mybearworld/mroew.git\n   ```\n5. Set your `gleam.toml` to:\n   ```toml\n   name = &quot;my-scratch-project&quot;\n   version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;\n   target = &quot;javascript&quot;\n   [dependencies]\n   gleam_stdlib = &quot;~&gt; 0.34 or ~&gt; 1.0&quot;\n   mroew = { path = &quot;./mroew&quot; }\n   ```\n6. Create your Mröw project in `src/my-scratch-project.gleam`!\n7. To create the sb3 file, run `gleam run`.\n8. (Recommended) Add sb3 files to the gitignore:\n   ```ignore\n   *.sb3\n   ```\n9. If you want to update Mröw, run this:\n   ```sh\n   git submodule update --remote\n   ```\n\n## To do\n\n- Variables/lists\n- Custom blocks - for now you can just make a function\n","url":"index.html"},{"doc":"mroew/blocks","title":"Block","content":"pub type Block {\n  Block(opcode: String, inputs: List(Input), fields: List(Field))\n}\n\nBlock(opcode: String, inputs: List(Input), fields: List(Field))\n\n\nSynonyms:\nmroew/blocks.Block\nmroew/blocks Block","url":"mroew/blocks.html#Block"},{"doc":"mroew/blocks","title":"BlockType","content":"pub type BlockType {\n  BTBlock(Block)\n  BTBlocks(main_block: Block, blocks: Blocks)\n}\n\nBTBlock(Block)\n\n\nBTBlocks(main_block: Block, blocks: Blocks)\n\n\nSynonyms:\nmroew/blocks.BlockType\nmroew/blocks BlockType","url":"mroew/blocks.html#BlockType"},{"doc":"mroew/blocks","title":"Blocks","content":"pub type Blocks =\n  List(BlockType)\n\n\nSynonyms:\nmroew/blocks.Blocks\nmroew/blocks Blocks","url":"mroew/blocks.html#Blocks"},{"doc":"mroew/blocks","title":"Field","content":"pub type Field {\n  Field(name: String, value: String, subvalue: Option(String))\n}\n\nField(name: String, value: String, subvalue: Option(String))\n\n\nSynonyms:\nmroew/blocks.Field\nmroew/blocks Field","url":"mroew/blocks.html#Field"},{"doc":"mroew/blocks","title":"Input","content":"pub type Input {\n  Input(name: String, default: Option(Operator), value: Operator)\n}\n\nInput(name: String, default: Option(Operator), value: Operator)\n\n\nSynonyms:\nmroew/blocks.Input\nmroew/blocks Input","url":"mroew/blocks.html#Input"},{"doc":"mroew/blocks","title":"Operator","content":"pub type Operator {\n  OInt(Int)\n  OFloat(Float)\n  OString(String)\n  OMessage(String)\n  OVar(String)\n  OList(String)\n  OComplex(Block)\n}\n\nOInt(Int)\n\n\nOFloat(Float)\n\n\nOString(String)\n\n\nOMessage(String)\n\n\nOVar(String)\n\n\nOList(String)\n\n\nOComplex(Block)\n\n\nSynonyms:\nmroew/blocks.Operator\nmroew/blocks Operator","url":"mroew/blocks.html#Operator"},{"doc":"mroew/blocks","title":"boolean","content":"pub fn boolean(operator: Operator) -&gt;
